# Prework - Background Changer

Submitted by: Yiyi Zhang

Background Changer is an app that changes the background to different shades of pink when you click the “Pink Me” button.

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## Optional Features

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
### My Favorite Apps

#### 1. TickTick  
- Smooth switch between daily, weekly, and monthly views
- Postpone key to move all overdue items to today

#### 2. WeChat  
- Only shows post comments from mutual friends 
- You can easily add custom sticker memes to chats

#### 3. Camera  
- Blurs the screen when viewed from the App Switcher
- Has a button to switch to the Photos app easily

#### 4. RedNote  
- Great personalized recommendation system 
- Gives you the option to either share your posts with potential connections or intentionally block them from seeing it

### My App Idea

I want to make a diary app that works like social media, but only for yourself.

You can write long posts like a blog, short ones like a tweet, or just post a photo. You can also leave comments on your old posts, like replying to your past self. It creates a kind of quiet conversation between who you were and who you are now.

There won’t be any social features. No followers, nothing public. Just a private space that feels honest and safe for reflection.
  
## Notes

I spent some time figuring out how to connect the button to the logic.
